                <p>
                    Elisabeth Adkins' richly varied musical life makes her equally at home in solo, orchestral, and
                    chamber
                    music repertoire. At the age of 25, she was awarded the position of Associate Concertmaster of the
                    National Symphony Orchestra (NSO) in Washington, D.C. by Music Director Mstislav Rostropovich. Over
                    an
                    orchestral career that spans four decades, she has worked closely with the most celebrated
                    conductors,
                    composers and soloists of our time. Dr. Adkins appeared with the NSO as concerto soloist on numerous
                    occasions, including at the special request of the late Iona Brown, whom she joined in Bach's
                    Concerto
                    for Two Violins. She has also appeared as soloist with the Dallas, Seattle, and Baltimore
                    Symphonies.
                    Other performances include concertos by Beethoven, Bruch, Glazunov, Saint-SaÃ«ns, Mendelssohn,
                    Mozart,
                    Vivaldi, and Prokofiev.
                </p>


                <p>
                    Dr. Adkins collaborates with her husband, pianist Edward Newman, in a violin/piano duo. Their
                    National
                    Gallery recital was chosen to inaugurate WETA's series Front Row Washington. In addition to frequent
                    appearances at the Kennedy Center and throughout the mid-Atlantic region, the duo was featured at a
                    special concert for both houses of Congress in the Capitol Rotunda.

                <p>
                    Dr. Adkins is a noted interpreter of the contemporary repertoire. As solo violinist with the 21st
                    Century Consort, directed by Christopher Kendall, she has premiered and recorded a number of works
                    and
                    is a favorite collaborator for many American composers. She has served as concertmaster of the
                    Smithsonian Chamber Orchestra. Dr. Adkins was a founding member of the American Chamber Players and
                    recorded with the group on Koch International Classics.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In great demand as teacher and coach, Dr. Adkins has been on the faculty of the University of
                    Maryland,
                    the National Orchestral Institute, the Wintergreen Summer Festival and Academy, and the NSO's Youth
                    Fellowship Program. Her positions on the faculty of both the NSO's Summer Music Institute and the
                    National Orchestral Institute at the University of Maryland have allowed her to work intensively
                    with
                    young people interested in pursuing orchestral careers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In August of 2014, after thirty-one seasons with the NSO, Ms. Adkins left the orchestra to join the
                    faculty of Texas Christian University School of Music in Fort Worth. She welcomes the opportunity to
                    focus on teaching and training at the college and graduate levels, while continuing to perform solo,
                    orchestral and chamber music. She joined several of her siblings as the resident quartet for the
                    Piano
                    Texas festival; the group played most of the major works of Brahms and Schumann for strings and
                    piano in
                    an intensive three-day chamber music weekend, joined by pianists Vadym Kholodenko, Davide Cabassi,
                    and
                    John Owings. Dr. Adkins has served as concertmaster for the Plano Symphony Orchestra since 2019.
